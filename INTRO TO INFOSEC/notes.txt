CHAPTER 1 SUMMARY:

- Breaking ciphers: ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, choosen-plaintext, choosen-ciphertext attacks.
- Classical ciphers:
	+ Shift
	+ Mono-alphabetical ciphers (broken by cryptanalysis)
	+ Vigenere (can perform cryptanalysis as long as you know p: key-length)

- Index of coincidence:
	+ Formula
	+ Attack to find keylength in Vigenere

- On the topic of perfect secrecy.

CHAPTER 2 SUMMARY:

- Block-ciphers:

+ S-boxes structures;
+ DES
	Weakness: Complement property -> Allow the attacker to lower the key-space needed to brute-force by half
+ AES (Rijndael)

Block ciphers mode of operation

 ECB:
 CBC
 CFB
 OFB
 CTR

CHAPTER 3-4:

PKC: applications : Hiding extremely important info / Digital signatures
