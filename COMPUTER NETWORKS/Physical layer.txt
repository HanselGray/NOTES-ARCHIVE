- Twisted cable : needs amplification / repeat of signal after ~ 100m

- For optic-fiber cables, in the order of descending distortion levels: 
	Multimode, step-index -> multimode, graded-index -> single-mode

- Advantages of multimode over single mode : allows the transmission of multiple channel of data within a single cable
